Java Coding Test
===============

Take a look over the code in this repo.

As part of this exercise we intend to build a very simple questionnaire webservice (that runs on port 8085) and will have 2 REST endpoints:

1. /questionsWithScores - Returns the list of questions along with the scores
   
2. /questionsOverScore?score=20 - Returns the list of only those questions which have a score of 20 or higher.
   
It is expected that you will produce:
   
   * Tested maintainable code
   * Clean code and OOP design

System Requirements
===================

 * Java JDK 11 
 * Maven 3.6.3 or higher
 * IntelliJ/ Eclipse IDE

Version Control
===============
The project is under "git" version control (only local, there is no remote), feel free to commit to the local
repository (if needed) during your development.


Good luck!
